                                Respected sir/Ma'am,<br>
                                &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp My name is Vijay Patil. I am pursuing my higher studies in 
                                Vadodara, BTech CSE-AI degree from <br>
                                Parul Institute of Engineering & Technology (Parul University). <br>
                                &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp My interest lies in Programming, DSA, and Programming languages like C, CPP, Python, and moderate Java.<br> 
                                I found myself interested in AI, ML, and DL fields as well, and this is the perfect choice <br>
                                for me. I am a bit of a bookworm, but when I am not studying, you will find me clicking pictures of my friends, <br>
                                photographs of nature, or anything in my surroundings. playing chess is my hobby, and I use my free time to <br>
                                capture pictures, video games, talk with friends on the topic of technologies of the upcoming future, draw, etc.<br> 
                                I am also a member of the SAP learner of our centre of excellence department of my college and also a <br>
                                coordinator of it.<br>
                                &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp I am a hardworking candidate and my dream organizations are Google, Facebook, <br>
                                Amazon, and Microsoft. My long-term goal is to work with a reputed company and gain knowledge about my area<br>
                                of interest. and know the customer needs as well as help the organization also. If I had to describe myself in <br>
                                one word, it would be dynamic as I accept challenges with a positive spirit, and I am always eager to learn.<br>
